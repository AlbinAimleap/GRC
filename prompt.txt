Your task is to calculate and update the unit price and the promo price based on the first sentence of the `promo_description` given in the input. The description may include a fixed price, a discount percentage, a quantity, a minimum spend condition, or a combination of these. If no promo description is provided, then the unit price and promo price should be the same as the regular price.

Please ensure the following:

1. **Fixed Price**: If the promo description provides a fixed price (e.g., "$6.99"), set the promo price to this amount, and calculate the unit price as follows:
   - `promo_price = fixed_price`
   - `unit_price = promo_price` (assuming the quantity is 1)

2. **Percentage Discount**: If the promo description contains a percentage (e.g., "10% off"), calculate the promo price as follows:
   - `promo_price = (sale_price if exists or regular_price) * (1 - (discount_percentage / 100))`
   - `unit_price = promo_price` (assuming the quantity is 1)

3. **Quantity-Based Discount**: If the promo description specifies a quantity (e.g., "Buy 3 for $11"), calculate the promo price and unit price as follows:
   - `promo_price = total_price` (e.g., $11)
   - `unit_price = promo_price / quantity`

4. **Buy X Get Y Free**: If the promo description mentions "Buy 1, Get 1 Free," calculate as follows:
   - `promo_price = (sale_price if exists or regular_price) / (X + Y)` (where X is the quantity bought and Y is the quantity free)
   - `unit_price = promo_price`

5. **Combination Discounts**: If both a quantity and a percentage discount are mentioned (e.g., "Buy 4 get 10% off"), first calculate the total for the quantity, then apply the discount:
   - `total_price = price for the specified quantity`
   - `promo_price = total_price * (1 - (discount_percentage / 100))`
   - `unit_price = promo_price / quantity`

6. **Minimum Spend Condition**: If the promo description mentions a discount for a minimum spend (e.g., "$5.00 off when you spend $25"), ensure the following:
   - **Do not apply the discount directly to individual items**. The discount is only valid if the total price of the participating items reaches or exceeds the minimum spend.
   - For each individual item, the `promo_price` should be the same as the `regular_price` or `sale_price`, unless the total cart meets the minimum spend. Therefore:
     - `promo_price = regular_price or sale_price`
     - `unit_price = promo_price`

7. **Limit Conditions**: If there is a limit on the number of items or the total amount (e.g., "Limit 2"), the discount is applied only up to the specified limit. Any additional items beyond the limit will be priced at regular or sale prices.

### Validation Process:
Before outputting the calculated results, ensure the following validation steps are applied:
- **Promo Price Check**: Validate that the calculated `promo_price` is logically consistent with the description (e.g., the promo price should not be less than zero or greater than the regular price unless explicitly stated).
- **Unit Price Consistency**: Ensure the `unit_price` is calculated correctly based on the promo price and any quantities or limits specified.
- **Format Validation**: Ensure all calculated results are properly formatted as valid JSON and conform to RFC8259.

Once the validation is complete and the results are confirmed to be accurate, generate the JSON response.
